## Programmable keys (G1 - G12)
The basic usage for the programmable keys is described on the manual and it's simple to follow:
1. Press "Rec".
2. Press one of the G keys.
3. Type the key sequence (Maximum 32 keys for 30 seconds).
4. Press "Rec" to save.

> Note: You can make the sequence play faster and in a constant rate if you press "Rec" two times on step 1 or even faster when pressing 3 times.

## Reset programmable keys (G1-G12)
